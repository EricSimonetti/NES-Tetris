# NES-Tetris
A remake of Tetris for the NES created using libGDX. I researched frame data for the game to make the mechanics work just like the original. I implemented mechanics like das and the specifics of the gravity in the game. The B game is not yet implemented. The program is a java application and can be run like one, or imported as an intellij 
project and run from within there. All of the .idea files are included in the repo.

Here are some screenshots of the game! It even has original music and sounds.

Colors and speed of blocks change by level just like in the real game:
